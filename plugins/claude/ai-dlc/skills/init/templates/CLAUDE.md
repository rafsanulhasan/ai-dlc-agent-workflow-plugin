@AGENTS.md

> Agent orchestration, routing, gates and memory rules live in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), imported above. Claude Code reads `AGENTS.md` on its own only when there is no `CLAUDE.md`, so the import is what loads it here.

## Workspace folders (Claude Code)

- Write scratch files to `{{SCRATCHPAD_ROOT}}/<session-or-task>/` instead of Claude Code's built-in per-session scratchpad directory or the system temp directory.
- `claude --worktree`, `EnterWorktree` and agents with `isolation: "worktree"` get their worktree under `{{WORKTREE_ROOT}}/` through the `WorktreeCreate` hook in `.claude/settings.json`. Claude Code keeps the worktrees it creates for subagents; remove each with `git worktree remove` once its branch is merged.
